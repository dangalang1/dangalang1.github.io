Lab 2 Part 3 (Hello World) 

    In Lab 2, there are three parts to this lab, however part 3 was my favorite. Lab 2, part 3, was my favorite because it was the iconic very first project a computer programmer can do which is to create a program that says Hello World! This part allowed me to see the introduction of computer coding and the introduction or the start of my coding career through my very first project. 

 

Lab 3 Part 3 (Hi-Lo Game) 

    In lab 3, there were three parts to the lab, however, part 3 of this lab was my favorite. Lab 3, Part 3, was about creating a guessing game, Hi-Lo. I enjoyed this part of the lab because I enjoyed creating a game to which I can relate too as I play games myself. This lab sparked my interest in creating and coding games. 

 

Lab 7 Part 2 (Blackjack Game) 

    In Lab 7, there were two parts to the lab, however, part 2 of the lab was my favorite. Lab 7, Part 2, was about creating the game simulation called Blackjack. This part of the lab helped me learn about how complicated the system of Blackjack is, especially the ace situation whether it would be 1 or 11.
